# GaussianProcess
My solutions to hwk 3 from COMS 4771 Spring 2020 at Columbia.

The assignment is ml_hw3.pdf

MLHwk3.pdf are my written solutions. I derive some useful properties of multivariate normals, I provide analysis of the outputs 
of various covariance matrices (and the kernels that create them), and I try to give the reader an intuition for why GP regression works, and how it differs from parametric regression. Readers will notice that my answers go beyond what is required for the question, but I only did that for the sake of learning. 

v.py graphs four random functions sampled from a multivariate normal with a few different, but ultimately arbitrary, covariance matrices

vi.py graphs four random functions sampled from a multivariate normal with covariance created by a gaussian kernel

vii.py graphs a periodic kernel

ix.py fits training data with a gaussian kernel 

x.py fits training data with a periodic kernel

# GaussianProcess

In the doc I derive some useful properties of multivariate normals, I provide analysis of the outputs 
of various covariance matrices (and the kernels that create them), and I try to give the reader an intuition for why GP regression works, and how it differs from parametric regression.

v.py graphs four random functions sampled from a multivariate normal with a few different, but ultimately arbitrary, covariance matrices

vi.py graphs four random functions sampled from a multivariate normal with covariance created by a gaussian kernel

vii.py graphs a periodic kernel

ix.py fits training data with a gaussian kernel 

x.py fits training data with a periodic kernel
